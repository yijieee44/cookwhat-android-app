## Workflow
To contribute, please follow the workflow below. **Only** push directly to the `master` branch if you know exactly what you're doing. Evaluate the impact of change before doing so.

1. Make sure your local master is up-to-date.

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    ```
2. Create a new local branch from your master branch to work on your changes.
    ```
    git checkout -b <my-feature-branch>
    ```
3. Make changes on your new branch. Add. Commit. Repeat.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "A meaningful commit message"
    ```
4. When you are ready to push your branch, make sure it's up-to-date with the remote master first.
    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout <my-feature-branch>
    git rebase master
    ```
5. Resolve conflicts if there's any.

6. Make sure there's no more conflict and you're now ready to push your changes to the remote repository.
    ```
    git push origin <my-feature-branch>
    ```
7. Open a merge request on github to merge your branch to master.
